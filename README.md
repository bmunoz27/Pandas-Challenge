# Pandas-Challenge

This challenge looks at data from a fantasy game called Heroes of Pymoli.
The way I went about analyzing the data was by using groupbys and bins to compare age demographics as well as gender. 
Each section is then displayed using a dataframe.

In order to open the file you might need to use the following path:

file_to_load = "../Resources/purchase_data.csv"
